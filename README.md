# Notes from the discussions

1. GUIs are just too complex to switch to easily
    
  a. going from raw_input() to event loop is a big perspective shift
  
  b. State management in guis is hard
  
  c. Just too complex (layout etc)
  
2. About gui designers

  a. Seems like a good idea
  
  b. Hard to do
  
  c. Very hard to do well
  
  d. Possibly not needed to make guis in python possible
  
  e. A stage-2 thing
  
3. Underlying GUI libraries:

  a. Kivy - good all-rounder, cross-platform, needs installation
  
  b. Tkinter - always available, but harder to manage under-the-hood
  
  c.
